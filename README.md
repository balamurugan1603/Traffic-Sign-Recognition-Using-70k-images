# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-70k-images

The Data is large to be shared here, So I'm sharing the link,
* Download Full Traffic Sign Images Data Here - https://www.kaggle.com/flo2607/traffic-signs-classification?select=myData (I do not own the data)
* Download Traffic Sign Images Data Split using split-folders package which is suitable for ImageDataGenerator() Here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmSjyDkoEavxc7WPwDJ6ORQ6cO-ud4M8/view?usp=sharing

NOTE: Ignore the label file in the zip files and kaggle (When I used data generator, the mappings were changed) and use the labels given in this repository.

* In this project I have successfully trained a Convolutional Neural Network with more than 70k images to correctly recognise 43 unique classes of traffic signs with an accuracy >97%. Also here I have trained only for 20 epochs and increasing it to 25-30 will surely improve the accuracy further.
