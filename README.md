* Download Traffic Sign Images Data Split using split-folders package which is suitable for ImageDataGenerator() Here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmSjyDkoEavxc7WPwDJ6ORQ6cO-ud4M8/view?usp=sharing

NOTE: Ignore the label file in the zip files (When I used data generator, the mappings changed) and use the labels given in this repository.
